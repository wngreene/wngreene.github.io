# wngreene.github.io

[W. Nicholas Greene's](http://wngreene.github.io) personal website, generated
using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Because this site uses custom Jekyll plugins, GitHub pages cannot generate it
automatically. The workaround is to commit the site output to the `master`
branch. The source code for the site is on the `dev` branch.
