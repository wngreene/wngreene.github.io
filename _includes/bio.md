I am a graduate student in the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (CSAIL) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),
interested in robotics, computer vision, and 3D perception. My research advisers
are Professor Nicholas Roy in the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and
Paul DeBitetto of Draper Laboratory where I am a Draper Laboratory Fellow. My
current interests are in developing aerial robots capable of autonomously
navigating and mapping complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments with only
onboard sensing.

Prior to joining CSAIL, I was an Assistant Technical Staff member in the
Advanced Sensor Techniques Group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory where I developed
state estimation algorithms for passive sonar applications. I earned my BSE in
Electrical Engineering from Princeton University in 2010.
