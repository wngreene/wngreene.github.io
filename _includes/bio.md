I am a PhD student in the [Robust Robotics Group]({{site.links.rrg}}) at
the
[MIT]({{site.links.mit}}) [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)]({{site.links.csail}}) under
[Professor Nicholas Roy]({{site.links.nickroy}}). During my Master's studies I
was co-advised by Pete Lommel and Ted Steiner of [Draper](site.links.draper)
where I was a Draper Fellow.

My current research is focused on robotics, computer vision, and 3D perception,
specifically developing aerial robots capable of autonomously mapping and
navigating unknown environments with only onboard sensing. I'm also very
interested in augmented reality, variational methods, and deep learning.

Prior to joining [CSAIL]({{site.links.csail}}), I was an Assistant Technical
Staff member in the Advanced Sensor Techniques Group at
[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]({{site.links.lincoln}}) where I developed state
estimation algorithms for passive sonar applications. I earned my BSE in
[Electrical Engineering]({{site.links.princetonee}}) from
[Princeton University]({{site.links.princeton}}) in 2010.
