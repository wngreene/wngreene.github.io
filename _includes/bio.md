I am a graduate student in the [Robust Robotics Group][rrg] at the
[Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)][csail] at
[MIT][mit], interested in robotics, computer vision, and 3D perception. My
research advisers are [Professor Nicholas Roy][nickroy] in the
[Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics][aeroastro] and Paul DeBitetto of
[Draper][draper] where I am a Draper Fellow. My current interests are in
developing aerial robots capable of autonomously navigating and mapping complex,
dynamic, and uncertain environments with only onboard sensing.

Prior to joining [CSAIL][csail], I was an Assistant Technical Staff member in
the Advanced Sensor Techniques Group at [MIT Lincoln Laboratory][lincoln] where
I developed state estimation algorithms for passive sonar applications. I earned
my BSE in [Electrical Engineering][princetonee] from
[Princeton University][princeton] in 2010.
