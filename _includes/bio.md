I am a graduate student in the
[Robust Robotics Group](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg) at the
[Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)](http://www.csail.mit.edu)
at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu), interested in robotics, computer vision, and 3D
perception. My research advisers are
[Professor Nicholas Roy](https://www.csail.mit.edu/user/902) in the
[Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics](http://aeroastro.mit.edu) and Paul
DeBitetto of [Draper](http://www.draper.com) where I am a Draper Fellow. My
current interests are in developing aerial robots capable of autonomously
navigating and mapping complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments with only
onboard sensing.

Prior to joining [CSAIL](http://www.csail.mit.edu), I was an Assistant Technical
Staff member in the Advanced Sensor Techniques Group at
[MIT Lincoln Laboratory](http://www.ll.mit.edu) where I developed state
estimation algorithms for passive sonar applications. I earned my BSE in
[Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.princeton.edu) from
[Princeton University](http://www.princeton.edu) in 2010.
