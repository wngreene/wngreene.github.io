I am a graduate student in the [Robust Robotics Group]({{site.links.rrg}}) at
the
[Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL)]({{site.links.csail}})
at [MIT]({{site.links.mit}}), interested in robotics, computer vision, and 3D
perception. My research advisers are
[Professor Nicholas Roy]({{site.links.nickroy}}) in the
[Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics]({{site.links.aeroastro}}) and Paul
DeBitetto of [Draper](site.links.draper) where I am a Draper Fellow. My current
interests are in developing aerial robots capable of autonomously navigating and
mapping complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments with only onboard sensing.

Prior to joining [CSAIL]({{site.links.csail}}), I was an Assistant Technical
Staff member in the Advanced Sensor Techniques Group at
[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]({{site.links.lincoln}}) where I developed state
estimation algorithms for passive sonar applications. I earned my BSE in
[Electrical Engineering]({{site.links.princetonee}}) from
[Princeton University]({{site.links.princeton}}) in 2010.
