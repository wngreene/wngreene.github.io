Hi! My name is Nick Greene and I'm a researcher and engineer in robotics,
computer vision, and 3D perception. I'm currently working at a robotics startup
in the Boston area.

I conducted my PhD studies in the [Robust Robotics Group]({{site.links.rrg}}) at
the [MIT]({{site.links.mit}}) [Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (CSAIL)]({{site.links.csail}}) under [Professor Nicholas
Roy]({{site.links.nickroy}}). My thesis explored leveraging prior information
for real-time monocular simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). I'm also
very interested in augmented reality, variational methods, and deep learning.

Prior to joining [CSAIL]({{site.links.csail}}), I was an Assistant Technical
Staff member in the Advanced Sensor Techniques Group at
[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]({{site.links.lincoln}}) where I developed state
estimation algorithms for passive sonar applications. I earned my BSE in
[Electrical Engineering]({{site.links.princetonee}}) from
[Princeton University]({{site.links.princeton}}).
